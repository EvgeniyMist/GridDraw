TODO:
	1) Add blocking of decreasing window size after reaching menu size
	2) Change the binding mechanism of nodes
	Now there is binding to a specific pixel,
	but there is necessity for binding to a specific point on the coordinate plane
	3) Add the ability to paint over limited areas
	4) Add save and load functions
	5) Add the ability to scale the grid, but not just change cell size, and move in it
	So user can draw a small part of picture in one part of the grid, then
	zoom out and go to another part of the grid, and after that zoom in for the next drawing
	6) Improve line quality (form of first and last points, spatial anti-aliasing)
